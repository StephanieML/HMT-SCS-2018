## Loading and running scripts

The root directory of this repository has a build file that resolves HMT project code libraries with their dependencies, so from the root directory of the repository, you can:

1.  Start an interactive console:  `sbt console`
2.  From the console, load a script, e.g., `:load scripts/writeImageTable.sc` (note the colon preceding the `load` command!)
