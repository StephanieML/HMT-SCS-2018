## what is markdown

## how are we using it

## where you can find the scripts


This repository includes a `scripts` directory with some scripts you can load run from the sbt console.  To do that, start the console:

    sbt console

Then, at the console prompt, use the sbt `:load` utility to load a  script.  (Note the preceding colon!)  Example:

    :load scripts/SCRIPT.sc


## To learn more

The scripts are just plain text files written in Scala.  If you want to learn more about how they work, see this brief [guide to the included scripts](../scripting)
