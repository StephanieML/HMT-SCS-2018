How Homer Multitext structures its data and why it's awesome

## Object, Text, Artifact Triangle

- all data interlinked with highly specific URNs
- image citation-Iliad line//scholia-manuscript page
  - done in simple .csv files
- *ceci n'est pas une pipe*


## CEX tables

## Using generic tools on technology-independent data

- visualization made possible by URN data structure
- can be easily applied to any project built around URNs
- tools built for URN data, *not* for the HMT
