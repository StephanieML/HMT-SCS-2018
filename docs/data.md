How Homer Multitext structures its data and why it's awesome

## Object, Text, Artifact Triangle

- all data interlinked with highly specific URNs
- image citation - *Iliad* 1.1 - 12r of the Venetus A 
  - done in simple .csv files
- *ceci n'est pas une pipe*
  - the image citation of a portion of 12r is *not* the same as the physical page 12r


## CEX tables
- simple tabular files for everything create these relationships
- X text is illustrated by Y image
- X text content corresponds to Y citable text

## Using generic tools on technology-independent data

- visualization made possible by URN data structure
- can be easily applied to any project built around URNs
- tools built for URN data, *not* for the HMT
